This repository is forked and adapted from a [four part workshop developed by AashitaK](https://www.kaggle.com) at Harvey Mudd College.

### Introduction:

The workshop series is designed with a focus on the practical aspects of machine learning. We will be working in Python and using real-world datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), the machine learning platform most suited for the “learn-by-doing” philosophy. The series is targeted towards complete beginners familiar with Python, but it is also designed adaptively so that you will be challenged even if you have some familiarity with machine learning tools.

### Topics covered in the guided sessions and hands-on exercises:  

Session 1: Setup: Python and Github
guided: 
    - Installing software: python, jupyter, git
    - Navigation and other basic commands in the terminal
    - Working with the p-ai-org github
    - Python: 
        - variables
        - data structures (numbers, lists, strings)
        - control flow (if, while, for)
        - functions
        - importing packages
hands-on: 
    - no exercises this week!

Session 2: Data analysis: numpy and pandas
- Pandas dataframes as the data structure for datasets
- Converting csv files to dataframes
- Slicing and indexing dataframes using conditionals as well as iloc and loc methods.
- Statistical summary and exploration of dataframes
- Detecting and filling missing values in the dataframes
- Regular expressions for data extraction
- Feature engineering such as creating new features
- Basic statistical plots using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Correlation among features
- Basic operations such as dropping rows/columns, setting index, replacing values of a column using a dictionary, etc.
- Split-apply-combine operations by grouping rows of a dataframe
- Encoding categorical variables
- Concatentating and merging dataframes
- More operations such as sorting the rows, creating a dataframe from the scratch, etc.
